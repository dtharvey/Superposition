<h4>Visuallizing a Fourier Series</h4>
<p>In this module we used two ways to display the Fourier series for a
square wave, a triangular wave, and a sawtooth wave: an overlay of the
individual sine waves in the Fourier series, and an equation that
describes the Fourier series. Both have limitations. Overlaying
individual sine waves results in a cluttered plot in which it is
difficult to discern between most sine waves beyond the first three. The
equation for a Fourier series explains how the amplitude and the
periodicity change from wave-to-wave—for a square wave, each successive
sine wave has an amplitude that decreases by a factor of <span class="math inline">\((2k - 1)\)</span> and a periodicity that increases
by a factor of <span class="math inline">\((2k - 1)\)</span>—but not in
way that is easy to visualize.</p>
<p>The plot on the right is a more useful way to visualize the Fourier
series for a square wave. Each vertical line gives the amplitude, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and the periodicity, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, for one of the first 15 terms in the
square wave’s Fourier series, with the first member of the series, <span class="math inline">\(k = 1\)</span>, on the far left. The position of
the vertical lines along the <em>x</em>-axis clearly shows that only
sine waves with an odd value of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>
contribute to the square wave’s Fourier series.The amplitude of each
sine wave in the Fourier series is displayed above its vertical
line.</p>

<h4>Data Sets Used in This Module</h4>
<p>You can use the download buttons on the upper right to retrieve the
data used in this module. Each file is in a csv format and has 15
columns. Each column gives the value of one sine wave, <span class="math inline">\(y(x)\)</span>, in the Fourier series from <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x =
4\pi\)</span> in intervals of <span class="math inline">\(0.01\pi\)</span>. The first column is for the sine
wave where <span class="math inline">\(k = 1\)</span> and the last
column is for the sine wave where <span class="math inline">\(k =
15\)</span>.</p>

<h4>Sources of Waves</h4>
<p>Our treatment of the superposition of waves did not consider the
source of these waves. Although in analytical chemistry we often think
of waves in terms of electromagnetic radiation, the superposition of
waves applies to any type of periodic disturbance in a medium: sound
waves, for example, are a common example, as are waves that move through
water.</p>
