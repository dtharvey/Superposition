<!-- text for complex waves -->
<p>When we add together two sine waves their sum is a periodic wave that
retains the smooth shape of a sine wave. If we add together three or
more sine waves we can generate more angular periodic waveforms—such as
square waves, triangular waves, and sawtooth waves—that are defined by
line segments.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Use the pop-up menu on the right to
select the square wave. Leave the slider set to 0 and do not select the
option to show individual sine waves. The dashed line shows two cycles
of a square wave. Describe the waveform’s shape, focusing on ways in
which it is similar to and different from a sine wave. Repeat for the
triangular wave and the sawtooth wave.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong> We can approximate each of these
periodic waveforms by adding together a series of simple sine waves.
Select the square wave and use the slider to explore how the quality of
the approximation depends on the number of sine waves used. Are there
features of the square wave that are easy to reproduce accurately and
are there features of the square wave that are difficult to reproduce
accurately? Repeat for the triangular wave and the sawtooth wave. For
clarity, do not display the individual sine waves.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Return to the square wave and note that
there is an equation shown below the figure that shows the summation of
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> individual sine waves, where
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> varies from 1 to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. This summation is called a
Fourier series. The amplitude of each sine wave in this series is the
product of two terms: the term <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{\pi}\)</span> that sits outside of the
summation, and the term <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2k-1}\)</span> that sits within the
summation. The periodicity of each sine wave is given by the term <span class="math inline">\((2k-1)\)</span> included within the <span class="math inline">\(\sin()\)</span> function. There is no term for
adjusting the phase angle of individual sine waves. Click on the radio
button to show the individual sine waves and then use the slider to
examine, in turn, the first three sine waves <em>k</em> = 1, 2, and 3 in
the Fourier series. Explain how the difference in the amplitudes and the
periodicities of the first three sine waves are consistent with the
equation for a square wave. Repeat for the triangular wave and the
sawtooth wave.</p>
