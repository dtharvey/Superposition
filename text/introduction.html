<h4>What is the Superposition of Waves?</h4>
<p>When two (or more) waves travel in the same direction along the same
axis, the result is a single wave that is the sum of the individual
waves. This is the principle of superposition, which we illustrate here
using the figure on the right. Each row shows two individual sine waves,
identified as <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span>, and their sum, <span class="math inline">\(y_3\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(y_3 = y_1 + y_2\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the first row, the sine waves <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span> are identical and equal to <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x)\)</span>. Adding these waves together
gives a new sine wave, <span class="math inline">\(y_3\)</span>, that
has the same periodicity, but an amplitude that is twice that of <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the second row, one of the sine waves, <span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span>, is shifted by a phase angle of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> relative to the other sine wave,
<span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span>. This places the two waves in
direct opposition to each other, such that for every value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, the amplitude of <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> is equal in magnitude but opposite in
sign to the amplitude of <span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span>; as a
result, their sum, <span class="math inline">\(y_3\)</span>, has an
amplitude of 0 for all values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the third row, the periodicity of the second sine wave, <span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span>, is twice that of the first sine
wave, <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span>, which doubles the number
of oscillations. The sum of <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span> gives a new wave, <span class="math inline">\(y_3\)</span>, that exhibits a more complex
repeating pattern.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The example in the last row is particularly interesting as it
suggests we can build a library of repeating patterns by adding together
an appropriate set of sine waves.</p>
