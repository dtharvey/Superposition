# Superposition

Introduces students to the superposition of waves. The first activity explores the superposition of two sine waves, and explores how the properties of the individual sine waves---amplitude, periodicity, and phase---affects their sum. The second activity examines how summing together multiple sine waves leads to a square wave, a triangular wave, and a sawtooth wave.
